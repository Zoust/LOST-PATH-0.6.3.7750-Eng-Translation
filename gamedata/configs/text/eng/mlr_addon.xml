<text>Okay, will check it out.</text>
</string>

<string id="aslan_st_0">
<text>How and in what way it is better to go to "work".</text>
</string>
<string id="aslan_st_1">
<text>Look here: "syndicate" in the Area has only one Central base - our. South cut trail again, the psi setting on the Amber works the crowd at times zombar rod out in the arms of the mutants. Limansk in the North busy with us, but more godforsaken place is a maze and fanatics. In the East the Army Warehouses, the area of Freedom. </text>
</string>
<string id="aslan_st_2">
<text>[more...]</text>
</string>
<string id="aslan_st_3">
<text>as for the hazards - assess yourself, but keep in mind that when you fulfill orders - you're at work and feelings with snot throw a fuck or put it on a shelf, no morality - only calculation. About trails through Limansk is the safest in terms of displacement. There is a closed space, the sniper's possible you can't fully shelter from the ejection, and in case of a prolonged firefight. There are also disadvantages - it is the unpredictability of the terrain, I don't know what's around the corner.</text>
</string>
<string id="aslan_st_4">
 <text>are You saying the base is Central, so there are more outposts?</text>
</string>
<string id="aslan_st_5">
<text>I know there are three little dots. First Creek, at the edge of a vast filthy "Northern" wetlands. The second in the middle of nowhere, on the Outskirts of Pripyat. And we have a settled group in which the supplier is behind the bridge in Limansk on the edge of the "Red forest". You can also find our group on the whole Area during execution of various contracts.</text>
</string>
<string id="aslan_st_6">
<text>For Liman's territory "Monolith", as I understand it.</text>
</string> 
 <string id="aslan_st_7">
<text>Hospital there is an old, but sense to climb there is a trail of the Chernobyl NPP and Plant Amber cut of psy-radiation. After you reach Limansk, hold on the road to the South, but stock up with ammo and first aid kits.</text>
</string>
<string id="aslan_st_8">
<text>Accepted, a huge "thank you."</text>
</string>

<string id="sultan_st_0">
<text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
</string>
<string id="sultan_st_1">
 <text>Listen carefully. I'm the godfather, my name you already know. Not long ago I walked back here from the Creek and the guys with me pulled. Of the mutants we'd vypustili and regenerated the database. In Zaton I just punted. Pretended to be her and framed. Had to run off there.</text>

</string>
<string id="sultan_st_6">
<text>It is clear, and where more or less could easily be my ass.</text>
</string>
<string id="sultan_st_7">
 <text>Listen carefully, kid. From the North Cemetery equipment dogs our there on the old CAT road and the exits from the Military Warehouses brand held in the Cemetery that night try not to roam and generally avoid junk old. Background rattle sometimes so that the ringing of the balls is heard, plus the anomalies of the circle and "swaroski" local not asleep. To the West of the Landfill, and there is complete anarchy and say you can not do anything specific on it, just know about the checkpoint dolgovtsev in the North. South grove is a huge, Dark ravine called the wild warriors there periodically patrol and stalkery hang out. About the Hollow I forgot to mention, on the way to it, but we have on the Farm old stalkers eyes calluses, be careful. The Groves that has a huge plus, the road and exit from it are on the Border, our will find no problems. The Cordon of ATP to keep the old try.</text>

</string>
<string id="bandit_trader_st_5">
 <text>How do you wear out my ears, I will tell so be it. Before my first trip even with the "Scoop" of my story has its roots. Life I beautiful wanted. Speculation hunted, spalvis on the deal one went to jail. Time rewind started Dating a new to look and found Kent new stolen and traded. For three years he lived - then again, a period of time. Leaned back and "scoop" is already there. You know what saskarne?</text>

<text>Life is so shit.</text>
</string>
<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_9">
 <text>Flooded the fucking band life. Got a simple mechanic to the housing office, found a friend there, Vic. The money was paid "gulkin fuck" to drink good enough. Thumped once Kent shit I don't even remember what it was about. In General, I it out with a screwdriver stabbed, well that is not dying it. Gave me a few years strogacha. Wife a bitch while I was sitting there all sold out and disappeared. Leaned back when - and drove home and everything that is left in him. Money drunk and bummed for a long time after that. As the Zone was formed, I decided to pull in here, here all are equal - all pests are the same. Went to the thieves to the Landfill, assessing me as the local mechanics were allowed to stay. The best time in my life, guns and vodka hauling boxes.</text>
</string>

<text>Here is not a Dump, bro.</text>

<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_11">
 <text>Again, you interrupt. Came the Big Release, we hid like fryer last holes.

<text>I will Consider.</text>

<string id="loki_st_0">
<text>You're in charge here?</text>
</string>
<string id="loki_st_1">
<text>the way it is - my name is Loki, Deputy Mikluho at this Station.</text>
</string>
 <string id="loki_st_2">
<text>Interesting name - like the Scandinavian deity so called.</text>
</string>
<string id="loki_st_3">
<text>the way it is. Clung to me during the break through the "Burner." Dashing times were.</text>
</string>
<string id="loki_st_4">
<text>Tell?</text>
</string>
<string id="loki_st_5">
 <text>Good. When turned off "the Burner", my detachment marched North. Long went wild place around. Both on the horizon loomed Chernobyl, a place for the camp to look for started. Found this station abandoned and settled here. Further fever Zone start and there was "Debt". Unfamiliar places, people few, and emissions are frequent. Signing the truce, agreed to at the Station to keep guns holstered and knives sheathed.</text>
</string>
<string id="loki_st_6">
<text>And where are these dolgovtsev?</text>
</string>
<string id="loki_st_7">
 <text>No their who to shoot did not, they ran. Not so long ago we got the real Stalker one, Sasha called. Robust design has helped us a lot of good things done. But the last straw was the information of the CCP of their founder, according to which the Debt was founded by former military on compulsory basis. Their captain (the late General) simply cut off communication with the headquarters. This infuriated the local stalking, exactly as puzzled by some enemy fighters. All we had at the station was purely a balance. And then using the stalkers and soldiers have appeared, well, like straight from the air, and defectors with sympathetic was full. Here we force a "Debt" hence banished.</text>
</string> 
<string id="loki_st_8">
<text>where is this Stalker go away?</text>
</string>
<string id="loki_st_9">
<text>don't know, but last time it together with the "company" was seen going in the direction of "Jupiter". And not before I was, to be honest.</text>
</string>
<string id="loki_st_10">
<text>Tell me about the area. What fear is?</text>
</string>
<string id="loki_st_11">
 <text>Beasts full. And frankly, we missed the "Monolith", the bastards managed to settle in the old Depot. In General a decent base they have there. In the North in Kopachi fully zombified, near the ventilation complex and SAM "Volkhov" them too much, keep your eyes open.</text>
